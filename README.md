## Overview
Project Peek-A-Boo is a mobile application that alerts users in anticipation of jump scares from a database of over 500 scary movies.

The purpose of Project Peek-A-Boo is to make scary and intense movies more accessible to all types of audiences. Many movie-watchers
either avoid horror/scary movies altogether or read the plot in advance to make the experience more tolerable. We wanted to help
alleviate the scariness of watching a scary movie while avoiding the need for spoilers by creating this notification system for jump scares.

Once a user enters the mobile application, they are able to select from a database of over 500 scary movies. They are then able to
choose specifically which filters to apply. The main screen is a timer that can be played or paused in sync with the movie, and push
notifications will be sent to alert the user that a jump scare will occur in exactly 15 seconds, whether the phone screen is on or off.
